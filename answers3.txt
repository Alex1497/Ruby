1. You may have noticed some repetition in the Static Pages controller test (Listing 3.24). In particular, 
the base title, “Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App”, is the same for every title test. Using 
the special function setup, which is automatically run before every test, verify that the tests in Listing 
3.30 are still green. (Listing 3.30 uses an instance variable, seen briefly in Section 2.2.2 and covered 
further in Section 4.4.5, combined with string interpolation, which is covered further in Section 4.2.2.) 

all tests are  still green
